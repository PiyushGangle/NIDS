# NIDS

The Goal of this project to detect intrusions like DDOS, TCP SYN flooding,
ARP spoofing, Smurf DOS, Nmap and others and to take actions according to
some predefined rules so that systems can be made intrusion free and proper
responses can be given to the clients to function properly.
We have used various open source softwares tools to monitor the traffic in a
network and propose possible solution to the clients in order to prevent these
kinds of attacks.
